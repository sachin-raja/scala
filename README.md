# Learning Scala
Scala is a general-purpose programming language. 
It supports object oriented, functional and imperative programming approaches. 
It is a strong static type language.
In Scala, everything is an object whether it is a function or a number. 
It does not have concept of primitive data. 

File extension of scala source file may be either .scala or .sc 

You can create any kind of application like web application, enterprise application, mobile application, desktop based application etc.

Creating the project: 
    - Open up IntelliJ and click File => New => Project 
    - On the left panel, select Scala. On the right panel, select IDEA.
    - Name the project sample 
    - Assuming this is your first time creating a Scala project with IntelliJ, you’ll need to install a Scala SDK. To the right of the Scala SDK field, click the Create button. 
    - Select the highest version number (e.g. 2.13.3) and click Download. This might take a few minutes but subsequent projects can use the same SDK. 
    - Once the SDK is created and you’re back to the “New Project” window click Finish.

In intellij use the Scala plugin and sbt

A typical Scala Directory Structure: 
  - .idea (IntelliJ files) 
  - project (plugins and additional settings for sbt) 
  - src (source files) 
      - main (application code) 
          - java (Java source files) 
          - scala (Scala source files) <-- This is all we need for now 
          - scala-2.13 (Scala 2.13 specific files) 
      - test (unit tests) 
  - target (generated files) 
  - build.sbt (build definition file for sbt)
